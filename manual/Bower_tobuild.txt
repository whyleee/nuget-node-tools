Additional steps required to build new "Bower" package:

1) Before "nuget pack":
    - run `npm ls -parseable | sort length -descending` to find long paths to modules
    - move/flatten modules with longest paths
    - see changes made for 1.3.11 version:
        - move 'package-json' to the root and flatten
        - flatten 'lodash.debounce' in 'insight'
        - move 'string-length' to the root and flatten
        - move 'js-yaml' to the root and flatten
   [fix] Issue posted to NuGet community to add support for long paths (https://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/4311)
